#REST API ENDPOINT PROJECT

RestAPIEndpointProject is a Java software that parses a HTML specific page from a PlayStation website 
(https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4) to a Document Java Object using the framework Jsoup. 
It runs under the webserver Jetty that is granted by the Java framework called Spark. 

Spark Framework is a simple and expressive Java/Kotlin web framework DSL built for rapid development. 
Sparks intention is to provide an alternative for Kotlin/Java developers that want to develop their 
web applications as expressive as possible and with minimal boilerplate. 
With a clear philosophy Spark is designed not only to make you more productive, 
but also to make your code better under the influence of Spark’s sleek, 
declarative and expressive syntax.
